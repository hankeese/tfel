# Known incompatibilities

When compiling with option `TFEL_APPEND_VERSION` set to `ON` or when
defining the string variable `TFEL_VERSION_FLAVOUR`, the `python`
modules are now modified to reflect those information. This old
behaviour can be restored by setting the
`unversioned-python-module-names` option to `ON`.

# New features in the `TFEL` libraries

## Environment

This version now supports a new environment variable to specify the
`TFEL` installation directory that always supersedes the `TFELHOME`
environment variable. The name of this variable depends on the version
of the project, the fact that a development version has been compiled
and the flavour (optionally specified with the `cmake` variable
`TFEL_VERSION_FLAVOUR`). The name of this variable can be retrieved with
the `--tfel-home` option of `tfel-config` described below.

## `tfel-config` {#sec:tfel_5.1:tfel_config}

### `--registry-key` option

On `Windows`, the `--registry-key` option returns the registry key which
is used to determine the TFEL's installation path.

### `--tfel-home` option

The `--tfel-home` option returns the environment variable in which the
TFEL's installation path shall be defined. 

#### Example of usage

~~~~
$ tfel-config-5.2.0-dev-release --tfel-home
TFELHOME_5_2_0_dev_release
~~~~

### `--python-module-suffix` option

This option return the suffix of the `python` module. Such suffix is not
empty only the following conditions are met:

- `TFEL` has been compiled with option `TFEL_APPEND_VERSION` set to `ON` and or
  with the string variable `TFEL_VERSION_FLAVOUR` defined,
- the `unversioned-python-module-names` option has been set to `ON` (the
  default value if `OFF`).

The option `--python-module-suffix` is only available if the python
bindings is available.

### `--config`

This option requests flags associated with the `TFELConfig` library.

### `--mfront-log-stream`

This option requests flags associated with the `MFrontLogStream` library.

### `--mfront`

This option requests flags associated with the `TFELMFront` library.

### `--mtest`

This option requests flags associated with the `TFELMTest` library.

#### Example of usage

~~~~
$ tfel-config-5.1.0-release --python-module-suffix
5_1_0_release
~~~~

# New `TFEL/Material` features

## Homogenization

### Ellipsoidal inclusion embedded in anisotropic matrix

When \(\tenseur C_0\) is anisotropic, the Eshelby tensor can be computed
with `computeAnisotropicEshelbyTensor` in 3D and `computePlainStrainAnisotropicEshelbyTensor`
in 2D. There are also `computeAnisotropicHillTensor`, `computePlainStrainAnisotropicHillTensor`,
and also `computeAnisotropicLocalisationTensor` and `computePlainStrainAnisotropicLocalisationTensor`.

### Homogenization bounds

Different homogenization bounds are implemented.
The available functions are `computeVoigtStiffness`, `computeReussStiffness`,
`computeIsotropicHashinShtrikmanBounds`.

## Python bindings

Python bindings are now generated using the
[`pybind11`](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) library.

# New features in `MFront`

This version introduces the following main features in `MFront`:

- warnings on  potential misuses or known bad practices,
- the ability to call other behaviour from a behaviour.

## Warnings

Many warnings have been added to detect potential misuses of `MFront` or
known bad practices.

### Activating and desactivating warnings

Reporting warnings is activated by default and can be disabled by
passing the command line argument `--report-warnings=false` to `MFront`.

Warnings are associated with keywords and code blocks. Warnings can be
disabled by appending the `safe` option to them. For instance, in an
implicit DSL, specifying a convergence threshold greater than
\(10^{-10}\) is considered to loose in most cases and thus triggers a
warning. This warning can be disabled as follows:

~~~~{.cxx}
@Epsilon<safe> 1;
~~~~

This `safe` option can be ignored by passing the `--ignore-safe` command
line argument to `MFront`. This argument is useful when analysing an
existing file (written by another person) to question implementation
choices.

### Warnings added to all DSLs

### Warnings added to isotropic DSLs

#### Warnings related to the convergence threshold

- using the default value of the convergence threshold
- specifying a value of the convergence threshold too low
- specifying a value of the convergence threshold too high

#### Warnings related to the implementation of the flow rule(s)

A warning is reported if the implementation of the flow rule(s)
contains:

- the time increment `dt`,
- the strain `eto` at the beginning of the time step,
- the strain increment `deto`,
- the stress `sig`,
- the `theta` parameter,
- the increment of the external state variable,
- an auxiliary state variable not computed by an external point-wise
  model (see the `@Model` keyword).

#### Warnings related to the convergence threshold

- using the default value of the convergence threshold
- specifying a value of the convergence threshold too low
- specifying a value of the convergence threshold too high

### Warnings added to implicit DSLs

#### Warnings related to the convergence threshold

- using the default value of the convergence threshold
- specifying a value of the convergence threshold too low
- specifying a value of the convergence threshold too high

#### Warnings related to the computation of the thermodynamic forces

- using the \(\theta\) (i.e. `theta`) or the `iterMax` parameter.
- using the time increment \(\Delta\, t\).
- using the increment of a gradient, integration variable or external
  state variable, or the increment of an auxiliary state variable
  computed by a point-wise model (see the `@Model` keyword).
- using an auxiliary state variable which is not computed by a point-wise model.

### Warnings added to interfaces

#### Warnings added to the `Cast3M` interface

- using a maximum number of substepping greater than 3.
- not restricting the following keywords to the `Cast3M` interface,
  which is a portability issue as the behaviour can't be compiled with
  other interfaces: `@CastemGenerateMTestFileOnFailure`,
  `@UMATGenerateMTestFileOnFailure`, `@CastemUseTimeSubStepping`,
  `@UMATUseTimeSubStepping`, `@CastemMaximumSubStepping`,
  `@UMATMaximumSubStepping`, `@CastemDoSubSteppingOnInvalidResults`,
  `@UMATDoSubSteppingOnInvalidResults`, `@CastemFiniteStrainStrategy`,
  `@UMATFiniteStrainStrategy`, `@CastemFiniteStrainStrategies` and
  `@UMATFiniteStrainStrategies`.

#### Warnings added to the `generic` interface

- not restricting the keyword
  `@GenericInterfaceGenerateMTestFileOnFailure` to the `generic`
  interface, which is a portability issue as the behaviour can't be
  compiled with other interfaces.

#### Warnings related to the perturbation value used to compute a numerical approximation of the jacobian

#### Warnings related to the convergence threshold

- using the default value
- specifying a value too low
- specifying a value too high

## Calling an external behaviour: the `@BehaviourVariable` keyword

```cxx
@BehaviourVariable first_phase_plastic_behaviour {
  file: "Plasticity.mfront",
  variables_suffix: "1",
  external_names_prefix: "FirstPhase",
  store_gradients: true,
  store_thermodynamic_forces: true,
  shared_material_properties: {".+"},
  shared_external_state_variables: {".+"}
};
```

### Behaviour variable factories

### Extension of the `@Model` keyword

In previous versions, the `@Model` keyword allowed to call from a
behaviour point-wise models using the historical `Model` DSL.

The `@Model` keyword now allows to use point-wise models implemented
using the following DSLs: `DefaultModel`, `RungeKuttaModel` and
`ImplicitModel`. In this case, a behaviour variable factory is
automatically associated with the point-wise models which shares all its
material properties and external state variables with the calling
behaviour. Every persistent variables of the point-wise model are
declared as auxiliary state variables. For each persistent variable of
the point-wise model, a local variable meant to contain the increment of
this variable over the time step is declared.

Point-wise models are called at the initialization stage of the
behaviour. The auxiliary state variables associated with the point-wise
models are updated at beginning of the `updateAuxiliarySateVariables`
method **before** any user defined code (see the
`@UpdateAuxiliaryStateVariables` keyword).

## New command line arguments

The following command line arguments are now supported:

- `--report-warnings`: this command line argument enables or disables
  the reporting of warnings:
  - `--report-warnings` or `--report-warnings=true` enable the reporting
    of warnings (which is the default behaviour of `MFront`).
  - `--report-warnings=false` disables the reporting of warnings.
- `--warning-error`: this command line argument allows to treat warnings
  as errors.
  - `--warning-error` or `--warning-error=true` turns warnings into
    errors.
  - `--warning-error=false` does not turn warnings into errors (which is
    the default behaviour of `MFront`).
- `-Werror` is equivalent to `--warning-error=true`.
- `-ignore-safe` allows to ignore the `safe` option of keywords and code
  blocks.

# New features in `mfront-query`

## New command line arguments

The following command line arguments are now supported:

- `--report-warnings`: this command line argument enables or disables
  the reporting of warnings:
  - `--report-warnings` or `--report-warnings=true` enable the reporting
    of warnings (which is the default behaviour of `mfront-query`).
  - `--report-warnings=false` disables the reporting of warnings.
- `--warning-error`: this command line argument allows to treat warnings
  as errors.
  - `--warning-error` or `--warning-error=true` turns warnings into
    errors.
  - `--warning-error=false` does not turn warnings into errors (which is
    the default behaviour of `mfront-query`).
- `-Werror` is equivalent to `--warning-error=true`.

## New keywords

### `@TFELLibraries`

The `@TFELLibraries` keyword let the user specify TFEL libraries to link
with. This keyword must be followed by an array of strings.

The following libraries are available: `Config`, `Exception`,
`Glossary`, `Tests`, `UnicodeSupport`, `Utilities`, `System`, `Math`,
`MathCubicSpline`, `MathKriging`, `MathParser`, `NUMODIS`, `Material`,
`MFront`, `MTest`.

#### Example of usage

~~~~{.cpp}
@TFELLibraries {"MathParser"};
~~~~
